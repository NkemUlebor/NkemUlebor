ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Nkem, a clinical exercise physiologist who is making a transition into the tech industry. I have a passion for health and wellness, and I'm excited to bring my skills and perspective to the tech world. This GitHub repository showcases my work as I learn new skills and explore opportunities in tech.

Background
I have a Bachelor's degree in Exercise Science and a Master's degree in Clinical Exercise Physiology. For the past 3 years, I have been working as a clinical exercise physiologist, helping patients with chronic diseases manage their conditions through exercise and lifestyle interventions. I have always been interested in how technology can be used to improve healthcare outcomes, and I'm eager to learn more about the intersection of health and tech.

Goals
My short-term goal is to gain a solid foundation in programming and software development. In the long-term, I hope to leverage my clinical experience and tech skills to create innovative solutions that improve patient outcomes.
